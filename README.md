# Reverse-Ray-Tracing
Implementation of algorithm for reverse ray tracing | Computer Graphics

## Files to be implmeneted

**Step-1** 3D model view of the world
1. Vector - 3D representation of a point
2. Ray - Representation of a line
3. Geomtrical Object - Sphere, Line and others (intersection)
4. Material RGB mapping
6. Camera (where to place in world)
7. VCS - WCS (transformation)
