- Do

Use GLUT: Make the scene
Use raytracer to get intersection points
Draw the lines in opengl


--- more steps ---
1. Use glut and make a scene: Make it read sphere for starters--DONE
- (The scene would consists of objects from input file) 
2. Make keyboard movements to view it in 3D: A little for starters---DONE
3. Call ray tracer and get intersection points
4. Draw these lines and complete the scene
- This is it.


-----steps---------------

1. Debug the lines showing in opengl: nope
2. Write a parser for opengl objects from inputsample - umm, still problems
3. Make a sphere at camera - done

4. Map texture from a file
5. Take input of affine transformations

6. Do mouse movements
